# Required entries:
#
#   infile      - The marc data file to convert
#   outfile     - The converted marc data file
#   errorfile   - A file to hold those records converted with errors
#   rejectfile  - A file to hold reject records
#   reportfile  - The report file for this run
#
#   filedate    - The 005 to use for this run. The format is CCYYMMDDhhmmss.0
#                 and the century must be either 19 or 20.
#
# Optional entries:
#
#   forcedate   - If 'Y' the filedate will be used to create all 005 fields,
#                 overriding the 005 in any input records. If 'N' the filedate
#                 will only be used to create 005 fields for those input records
#                 that do not contain a 005. Default is 'N'.
#
#   skip        - The number of input records to skip before conversion starts.
#                 Default's to 0, if the entry is not specified or is not numeric.
#                 Keyword values 'none' and 'all' may be specified.
#
#   maxin       - The maximum number of records to read from the file. This includes
#                 the number of records to skip, so if skip is greater than or equal
#                 maxin no records will be processed.
#                 Default's to 'all', if the entry is not specified or is not numeric.
#                 Keyword values 'none' and 'all' may be specified.
#
#   maxout      - The maximum number of records to convert. Rejected records are not
#                 included in this count.
#                 Default's to 'all', if the entry is not specified or is not numeric.
#                 Keyword values 'none' and 'all' may be specified.
#
#   debuglevel  - Controls the level of debug information written to the report file.
#                 A higher number will get more debug information. The actual meaning
#                 of this number is varies among conversion programs. The highest
#                 meaningful value is 3, which will ascii print each input and output
#                 marc records. To suppress debugging output specify 0.
#                 Default's to 0, if the entry is not specified or is not numeric.
#                 Keyword value 'none' may be specified.
#
#   validateout - Perform post-conversion valimrcion when this is 'Y', and byapss
#                 valimrcion of output records when it is 'N'. Default is 'Y'.
#
#   benchrun    - Set this to 'Y' when running a benchmark test. This will cause
#                 the $d subfield of any generated 998 fields to be set to the
#                 value of the benchdate parameter. Default is 'N'.
#
#   benchdate   - String to put in 998 $d subfields when benchrun is set to 'Y'.
#                 Default is 'BenchMarkDate'. Since the purpose of this field
#                 is to allow benchmark run to compare cleanly across runs this
#                 parameter should either be allowed to default. A good value
#                 to use to create benchmark results for chekcin to cvs is the
#                 release tag value.
